# Documentation Index

This folder contains the canonical documentation for the VerifySign monorepo.

- `architecture.md` – system overview, responsibilities and boundaries between apps/packages.
- `deployment.md` – build, environment configuration and delivery pipeline details.
- `api-reference.md` – contract for the Supabase functions and client helpers.
- `security.md` – auth, RLS and data-handling requirements.

All historical notes, session logs and scratch work now live under `docs/archive/` to keep the root clean while preserving context.
